-Displays warning lights

-Scrolling display by knob to the left of the steering wheel

-Clearly tells you what gear the car is in

-Alerts when a passenger is buckled up


Cons:

-Common issue is when I get to last gallon, the range changes to LOW rather than display miles left. 

-Tire pressure reading delayed sometimes when filling tires up



# Common uses of a Car Dashboard

-reading speed

-Telling if car is on

-seeing how much range (gas and/or electric) the car has

-Is there any issues with the car (any warning lights on or is a temperature gauge not acting normal)

-Is cruise control on or ready to be used

-Is turn signal on

-What gear is the car in

# Rate uses of a Car Dashboard

-Controlling music

-Using built in car navigation (I use navigation app)

-Telling which direction the car is facing (N, S, E, W)


# Improvements to be made

-I took general layout of my current car's Dashboard and improved it (Dashboard #5)

-Numeral speedometer in center, large font size to tell driver current speed

-added tachometer and engine temperature gauge

-made turn signals visible on screen

-Gear shown is top right and current gear is circled

-Kept screen to scroll through by dial which will be beside the Dashboard to left of driver

-Screen will have tire PSI, oil life, units, vehicle messages, trip A, trip B, and display current song. If you want to reset oil life, trip A, or trip B, hold down 
select button located in center of dial and wait for a beep

-Gasoline levels

  -Green from full tank up to 2 gallons left
  
  -Orange from 2 gallons left to 1 gallon
  
  -red from 1 gallon to empty
  
  -Will always display range even when on last gallon. Will send an alert and vehicle message every 5 miles driven while in Red 


# New Design:

![Untitled Diagram(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74264662/115173701-7cd37d80-a08d-11eb-87e2-11c026c18b1f.jpg)

Features:

Top left:

-Seat belt warning symbol and symbol for back passengers seat belts. When a seatbelt is buckled for passenger, their seat will turn green

Far left:

-Tire pressure warning light

-Check engine light

-Battery light

-Check airbag light

Center left:

-Tachometer measuring RPMs

Bottom left:

-Cars total mileage

Top Center:

-Left turn signal

-Cruise control is on and activated. When cruise control is on, the symbol will appear white. When the driver activates cruise control, the symbol will turn green. Buttons to control the cruise control are located on steering wheel

-Right turn signal

Center:

-Speedometer in mph. Instead of a gauge, I went for a speedometer that just tells the driver directly how fast they are going
